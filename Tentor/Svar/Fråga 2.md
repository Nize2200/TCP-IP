- A handoff is needed to ensure that the connection is still established when the change from one station to another occurs. It should not be broken.
  Another reason is that it handles traffic efficiently.

2 reasons to use the handoff are:
 1. Too many devices connecting so to enhance and "drop" some weight some devices are sent to the neighbor base station.
 2. A mobile host/device is in movement and to keep the communication "alive" and with a strong connection avoiding possible "errors" as delay the device connects to a BS with a stronger signal.
