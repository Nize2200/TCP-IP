## Satellite Radio Channels
A communication satellite links two or more Earth-based microwave transmitter/ receivers, known as ground stations. The satellite receives transmissions on one frequency band, regenerates the signal using a repeater 
### 1. Geostationary satellites

- Hög hastighet, används i ställen där kabel internet inte finns.
### 2. LEO satellites
- Åker runt jorden
- kommunicerar med andra satellites

## Application Layer
- Message/Data
- SMTP(Email), HTTP
## Transport Layer
- Segment
- Provides logical communication between processes, offering services like reliable data transfer (TCP) or connectionless communication (UDP).
- Port Numbers
## Network Layer
- Datagram
- Handles routing and forwarding of datagrams across networks, using IP for addressing and routing protocols like OSPF and BGP.
## Data Link
- Frames
- MAC address
- Switches
- Ensures data transfer between neighboring network nodes, including error detection and handling using protocols like Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
##  Physical
- Deals with the physical transmission of bits over a medium like copper wires, fiber optics, or wireless channels
## Questions:
### **R22**: If two end-systems are connected through multiple routers and the data-link level between them ensures reliable data delivery, is a transport protocol offering reliable data delivery between these two end-systems necessary? Why?
```
Yes, a transport protocol offering reliable data delivery is still necessary. The data-link layer ensures reliable delivery only on a hop-by-hop basis between adjacent nodes. It does not guarantee end-to-end reliability across multiple routers. A transport protocol like TCP provides end-to-end reliability, ensuring proper sequencing, retransmission of lost packets, and congestion control, which the data-link layer cannot handle on a global scale​
```
### ### **R24**: What do encapsulation and de-encapsulation mean? Why are they needed in a layered protocol stack?
```
- **Encapsulation**: At the sender's end, data from a higher layer is wrapped with protocol-specific headers or trailers at the lower layer. For example, an application-layer message is encapsulated into a transport-layer segment, which is then encapsulated into a network-layer datagram, and so on.
- 
- **De-encapsulation**: At the receiver's end, each layer processes and removes its headers or trailers to extract the payload for the higher layer.
- **Importance**: Encapsulation ensures modularity and abstraction in networking, enabling each layer to add its own control information. This layered approach simplifies networking tasks and promotes interoperability across different hardware and software​
```

### R25: Layers Processed by Different Devices
- **Router**: Processes layers 1 (Physical), 2 (Link), and 3 (Network).
- **Link-layer Switch**: Processes layers 1 (Physical) and 2 (Link).
- **Host**: Processes all five layers (Physical, Link, Network, Transport, and Application)​

### R26: What is self-replicating malware?
Self-replicating malware refers to malicious software that, once it infects a host, can autonomously spread to other hosts over a network. This type of malware exploits vulnerabilities to propagate itself without additional user action, leading to rapid and exponential spread across systems

### R27: Describe how a botnet can be created and how it can be used for a DDoS attack.
- **Creation**: A botnet is created by infecting multiple hosts (zombies) with malware, which allows an attacker to control them remotely. The malware typically exploits software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to devices like computers, IoT devices, or servers.
- **Usage for DDoS**: In a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, the attacker instructs all the compromised devices in the botnet to flood a target (e.g., a server) with an overwhelming amount of traffic. This exhausts the target's resources, causing legitimate users to lose access​

### R28: Malicious actions Trudy can perform in a man-in-the-middle position
If Trudy positions herself in the network and intercepts all packets between Alice and Bob, she can:

1. **Eavesdrop**: Passively listen to the communication, stealing sensitive information like passwords or private messages.
2. **Modify Messages**: Alter the contents of packets before forwarding them, potentially injecting false data.
3. **Impersonation**: Act as Bob to Alice and as Alice to Bob, misleading them into thinking they are communicating directly.
4. **Delete or Replay Packets**: Drop certain packets to disrupt communication or replay older packets to confuse or deceive.
5. **Session Hijacking**: Take control of an existing session to perform unauthorized actions​
