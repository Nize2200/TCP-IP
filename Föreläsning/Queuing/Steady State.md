## Steady State condition
- Enough time has passed for the system state to be 
  independent of the initial state as well as the elapsed time.
  
- The probability distribution of the state of the system remains
  the same over time (is stationary).

## Transient condition
- Prevalent when a queuing system has recently begun operations
  
- The state of the system is greatly affected by the initial state
  and by the time elapsed since operations started.
  
- The probability distribution of the state of the system changes with time
