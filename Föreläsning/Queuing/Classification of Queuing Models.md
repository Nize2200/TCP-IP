## Commonly used notation principle: A/B/C/K (Kendall's notation)
• A = The interarrival time distribution
• B = The service time distribution
• C = The number of parallel servers
• K = Maximum number of customer that can be in the system.
## Commonly used distributions
• M = Markovian (exponential) - **Memoryless**
• D = Deterministic distribution
• G = General distribution

## Example: M/M/c (M/M/c/∞)
Queuing system with ```exponentially``` distributed service 
and ```interarrival``` times and ```c servers```
