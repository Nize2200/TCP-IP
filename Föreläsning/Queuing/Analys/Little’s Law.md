## Formula
For a given arrival rate, the time in the system is proportional to customer occupancy

## Why?
Littleâ€™s law is very powerful as it does not depend on any specific
assumption on the arrival distribution, service time distribution,
number of servers, queuing size or queuing discipline.

## Example Scenarios:
- On rainy days, streets and highways are more crowded.
- Fast food restaurants need a smaller dining room than regular 
  restaurants with the same customer arrival rate.
- Large buffering together with large arrival rate cause large delays.
