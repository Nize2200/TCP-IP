- Population of customers or jobs

- The size can be finite or infinite (The latter is most common)

- Can be homogeneous (Only one type of customers/ jobs)

- Or heterogeneous (Several kinds of customers/jobs)

## In what pattern do jobs / customers arrive to the queueing system?
• Distribution of arrival times?
- 
• Batch arrivals?
- 
• Finite population?
- 
## Poisson arrival process often assumed
• Many real-world arrival processes can be modeled using a Poisson process
